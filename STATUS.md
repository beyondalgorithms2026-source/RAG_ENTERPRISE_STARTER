# STATUS.md — Milestone Progress Tracker

**Current Milestone:** M3 — Identity + SSO Auth

**Completed**
- M0: Baseline Stable Import (baseline-import-stable)
- M1: Profiles And Retrieval Controls (2026-04-01)
- M2: Retrieval Observability And Traceability (2026-04-01)

**M1 summary**
- DB-backed profile registries: embedding, reranker, LLM, retrieval, eval_pack
- Admin endpoints: GET /admin/profiles, POST /admin/profiles/active
- Resolver overlay pattern with TTL cache + Settings fallback
- All consumers (embedder, reranker, LLM client, retrieval) wired to profiles
- Eval reports include active profile metadata snapshot
- See docs/m1_profiles_and_retrieval_controls.md

**M2 summary**
- Request-level retrieval traces stored in `retrieval_traces` with requested/resolved mode, retrieval path, candidate counts, fallback reason, answer path, and active profile snapshot
- Stage-level latency traces captured for `search`, `rerank`, `ask`, and `total`, with `search_total` preserved on ask flows
- Score-path diagnostics persisted for top candidates: vector, keyword, combined, rerank, and anchor score
- Admin inspection endpoints added for trace listing and single-trace lookup
- Eval outputs include `report_metadata` with active profiles, retrieval settings, and per-case trace summaries
- See docs/m2_retrieval_observability_and_traceability.md

**Next actions**
- Start M3: identity and SSO auth
- Add authenticated user context to request handling
- Ensure `/ask` requires auth once middleware is wired

**Notes / DoD checklist (M2)**
- [x] Operators can explain why a query used a specific retrieval path
- [x] Latency is stored and inspectable per request
- [x] Eval output captures enough trace data to compare strategies meaningfully
- [x] docs/ note added
- [x] STATUS.md updated

**Notes / DoD checklist (M1)**
- [x] Switch embedding model by config and re-index successfully
- [x] Switch reranker on/off by config and see report deltas
- [x] Switch LLM model by config without breaking answer contract
- [x] Retrieval defaults are stored and visible by profile
- [x] Eval reports store active profile metadata
- [x] docs/ note added
- [x] STATUS.md updated
